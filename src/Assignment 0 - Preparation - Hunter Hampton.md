**Organization:**

>All elements within the page are full of design principles. It may look very basic but right off the bat, I can see **repetition** and **spacing** is used very well in his **3x6 grid**.
>
>As you can see, there is little **no use of categorization** on this page, **all of Tim Murphy's projects** are individually **located on the front page**. You can see that the designer used **maximum efficiency** on this page.

**Color Choice:**

>The color pallet is limited mostly to **B/W tones**, and **minimal/dull colors**. On paper this might sound like a bad decision, but because the previous principal follows this format I believe it works quite well.

**Functionality:**

>Tim Murphy's website is very **easy to use**, and **does not over-stimulate**. **All buttons** that are **not directly related** to his work are **located** solely **at the top** in a header fashion.
>
>Additionally, there is a "**Back to top**" button at the bottom of the page that automatically scrolls the user to the beginning for their convenience.

**Aesthetics:**

>The designer uses unique **shapes and lines** to categorize this website for interest the client.
>
> Something to note is that the **graphic elements consume the entire page**, the **typeface contrasts the graphics** to make information and buttons legible.

**Functionality:**

>As opposed to vertical scrolling, **content is automatically scrolling** horizontally. It is optional to manually scroll as well.
>
>This is an **effective method of content delivery**, it keeps fresh content moving while **not cluttering** the client's view.

**Aesthetics:**

>This design uses **plenty of colors** throughout the page in a way that **does not look cheap**. Additionally, **repetition** is used well such as within the font/type and graphic placement.

**Spacing:**

>Spacing is done very well here, keeping **content broken up** allows the **eye to flow easy** and absorb all information thoroughly.

## Introduction

Hi,

I'm Hunter Hampton, and I'm an IDM major at Drexel, and I'm looking to minor in Marketing. I am a sophomore but this is my first quarter at Drexel. I transferred from Rowan University in New Jersey mostly due to a lack of passion and quality on campus. Additionally, the city is really where I feel most at home so the urban campus suits me very well. I’ve always loved computers as well as design, so choosing Interactive Digital Media satisfies my natural urge to create and modify as it combines technical foundations with the design and user experience.

I think there are two types of graphic artists, there’s formal and science-oriented design and there’s experimental design. I find myself in the formal category as I love geometric design, but I very much appreciate experimental design concepts. I’d have to say that Adobe Illustrator is my favorite software but recently I’ve gained a lot of appreciation for Adobe Indesign, so maybe my opinion will change in the future.

I’ve created 3D models, performed my own photoshoots, and designed works of art, logos, and advertisement mockups with the Adobe Suite and Corel Painter. I hope to combine these foundations to pursue UX and UI and advertising. In these classes, I believe I’m a perfectionist as I never feel that my work is complete unless I’m proud of it. I bought myself a drawing tablet when I graduated to explore the field more and It brought me to realize that nothing interests me more than this career. The reason for that is everything has been designed. My point being that every aspect of human craft has been selected specifically to suit a purpose and I believe that I have the capability to improve the human experience in this manner. I simply hope that Drexel brings me to the next level as I pursue my career.

Lastly, I wouldn't consider my past experience with coding as good, however, the atmosphere gives me the sense that I will do much better than that last time. The faculty are very knowledgable in their fields and the facilities here are very well funded. Hopefully, this class is a turning page for my perception of computer science/coding and I can realize my aspirations with a better technological background.
